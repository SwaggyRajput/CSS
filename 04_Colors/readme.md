 ----------RGB---------------------------------
#rgb(red, green, blue)
#For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.
#To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
#To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

----------RGBA--------------------------------
#rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)
#0<=alpha<=1
#0->Transparent
#1->Translucent/Dark

----------HEX--------------------------------
#rrggbb
#Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).
#For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).
#To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.
#To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  
#Experiment by mixing the HEX values below:


----------HSL------------------------
#hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)
#Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.
#Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.
#Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white
